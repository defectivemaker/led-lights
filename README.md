This was entirely created from scratch to control LED lights by managing the current going through the red, green and blue part of the light.

I also decoded the IR signals from my TV remote so I was able to control the lights with my TV remote

The different animations available include: "constant", "fadeColour", "fadeRainbow", "jumpRainbow",
"strobeRainbow", "strobeColour"

I also wired and soldered all the parts together including MOFSETs to handle the high current, IR receiver, relay and a shoddy carbox box to hold it together.
